# clojure-project

UseCase 1: For core.clj folder
This is Clojure example code based on regex(regular expressions) on strings.

Why the project is useful:
It is useful for data validations on real time data (OLAP).

Functions applied:
Function with variable name has been defined.
Applied regex pattern using re-matches, filtered the string which can accept A-Z and 0-9 with 4 elements.
Using let bindings created a variable and applied filter operation on string.
if statement is used with empty function.

Why the project is useful:
It is useful for data validations on real time data.

Functions applied:
Functions with variable names has been defined.
Applied regex pattern using re-find, filtered the string for "309" code and applied map on different function variables.
